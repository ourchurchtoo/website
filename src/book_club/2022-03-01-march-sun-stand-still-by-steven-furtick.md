We thought we’d start off your Our Church Too book club year right, by making the step to dream and have hope for the future. Not all of our book choices throughout the months will be theology-based, but we couldn’t help not sharing a few of our favourites with you

Interspersed with the fictional universes you’ll be entering this year!



Sun Stand Still is based upon the book of Joshua in the Bible, chapter 10, where Joshua dares to dream big and asks God to make the sun stand still in the sky so he could fight for Israel. It gives practical advice and encourages you to start hoping and dreaming for big things as all things are possible with God at your side! And who doesn’t love hearing inspirational stories of dreams come true?



I’m looking forward to hearing about your Big Dreams that are going to be uncovered through reading this book…! You have the whole month ahead to digest and process but I’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas and questions on our [Discord channel.](https://discord.com/channels/874591551764955236/876919056995852288)



*“In short, I'm out to activate your audacious faith. To inspire you to ask God for the impossible…”*
