This month’s book of choice, Six of Crows, has actually been adapted into a Netflix TV show called Shadow and Bone! That being said, I would of course recommend you read the book before watching the TV show… Six of Crows is a fictional fantasy novel. And if you’re a fan of world-building books, this is the one for you. Alternatively, if you love a good bit of character development and mystery this will also make a good read.

The story follows a thieving crew and is primarily set in the city of Ketterdam (loosely inspired by Dutch Republic–era Amsterdam). Six of Crows is written from multiple perspectives, one of which is from Kaz Brekker, my personal favourite. It also switches between the rest of his crew who are attempting to pull off an impossible heist. 

I’m excited to hear your thoughts about Six of Crows, it’s one of my favourites! You can dedicate the whole of April to reading it but I’d love to hear your thoughts, ideas and questions on our Discord channel as you read.
