with every utterance
of that word p i e r c i n g
my ears, sharp and heavy,
I must physically heave
shoulders U P under that weight
balanced there, pause— i n h a l e ,
hold him uncomfortable,
unwieldy — unconscious to all
else while he rousts, bloody
bluebird failing at innocence
suffer its history: s t r u t t i n g
neglect, improper ordering of human
dignity and decaying other-deprecation,
seek any Light remaining in this language…
finding none, finally e x h a l e —
throw back shoulder boulder
let it r o l l down my back.
as this is Sunday morning,
 brace for the next wave.
hope to hear some Good between
it is not this way for all,
some let it f l u t t e r overhead
or welcome the crashing wash
as this title crafts their countenance,
 they revel in the alteration
I do not have to s t a y ,
but perhaps I am stronger
through this particular practice,
power in mindful non-participation
character chiseled by discomfort
