Over the decades it's clear that freedom comes at a cost for any marginalised community, it's no difference for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Intersex and Queer plus (LGBTIQ+) community, on  the ground of sexual orientation and gender identity. We must therefore strive to make a difference regardless of the environment or institutions that holds us in captivity. I suggest, we must consider the following Four Os.

 

1. Be ORGANISED in all the things we need to do, we must approach our activism with a clear purpose, strategically and with unity, because those who promote homophobia and enable hatred in society, politics and religion against the LGBTIQ+ communities are organised and funded. In order for us to counter and defeat their derogatory ideals, we as a people must also be organised and well resourced. There will be criticism but we must find the opportunity to do our best. There must be a high level of cooperation and unity within the LGBTIQ+ communities. We must always be ready to challenge homophobia, biphobia and transphobia wherever we see this, even within our own communities.  
2. Have a clear vision on how to OCCUPY the spaces of authority, too often LGBTIQ+ find ourselves intimidated and subjected to low grades and subservient post in society, we are forced to hide the realities of all of who we are. We are often oppressed with no opportunities to make a difference. With visibility comes higher responsibilities, when we occupy spaces, we do so to make a clear statement to end oppression and shatter barriers.  It's time that we occupy strategic posts and positions where we can make political, economic and religious influences, make a difference by being the person that brings change by being the person in post. When we occupy we can respond with culturally sensitive and traditionally appropriate service. 
3. Take OWNERSHIP of the future, with responsibilities and sustainability. By taking ownership, we provide security for the future generations of LGBTIQ+ people, for families, allies and friends. It's time to create safe spaces for the growth and wellness of our people. From Kindergarten to University campuses, from politics to religious communities, from commerce to trading. We must create a platform that unites us, to bring about a universal change to the world we hope for, be accountable for bringing about positive changes, stepping up the mark of resilience, even if this requires sacrifices. By taking ownership, we deliberately live in our truth even at a times and place where its seemingly too risky and dangerous to do.
4. OVERTAKE your enemies, obstructers, competitors, those who unjustly despise and discriminate against you, those who will go to any length to minimized the existence of the entire LGBTIQ+ communities. This is the time for authenticity, the truth of who we are without compromising the integrity of our cause, the quality that is required to make a difference. We must overtake with excellence, gratitude, intellect and opulence. By overtaking, we leave many nuisances behind, we set aside societal stupidity. We promote an ideal of inclusivity, neurodiversity and intersectionality when it comes to understanding the LGBTIQ+ community. It certainly takes the boldness, strength and courage of this community, our friends and allies to overtake.

 

The change we bring must be found in our commitment to be organised, to occupy strategically, take ownership and overtake the nuisances for the sake of the wellness and progress in the LGBTIQ+ communities.
