On the eve of a Reformation\
less Charlemagne, more Luther\
embodying a stubbornness \
that does not crust but rather expands; \
backwards into the ancient traditions\
unafraid of desert fathers and iconology\
honoring song and body\
liturgy and Spirit-filled wonder. \
Forward- casting all traditions aside \
to breathe in the contradiction\
the Oneness we may never inhabit. 

Some ask why we stay with this sharded concept:\
Church\
headed laden with pock-marked history,\
intolerance, unequally yoked to nationalism.\
What choice do we have? \
The Divine refuses to evade us\
and we want Them. 

We want fear-freedom\
If we are separate from God\
we want to keep building \
an upside-down Kingdom\
that declares we are not\
separate from each other

What can we do but listen?\
Be broken and rebuild over\
and over again\
intersectionality weaving us together.
