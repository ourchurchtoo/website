I used to live in the muddy streets of Life\
And bathe in other people’s filth.\
I was scared, alone, and cold.\
I used to walk the path alone, \
My feet were burned by poison ivy,\
But my Father lifted me up\
So I don’t have to climb mountains by myself. \
Grey does not become me\
And blood-red doesn’t suit my skin.\
I’d much rather wear the golden sun,\
The ivory cloudlets in my hair, \
And the green grass in my feet. \
I’m no longer a slave, \
I’m the daughter of the King. \
I’m no longer burdened by my weight, \
But I fly, soaring in the skies. \
And when shadows from my life before\
Come knocking to come back\
And guilt me into falling away, \
I remember that this burden had been taken, \
It’s gone, I don’t have it anymore. \
If I’m faultless in His eyes\
Then I’m faultless to the world.
