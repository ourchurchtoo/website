*For their vine comes from the vine of Sodom and from the fields of Gomorrah; their grapes are grapes of poison; their clusters are bitter. — Deuteronomy 32:32*\
\
Mid-morning market\
Banners, not yet tired,\
burst splendor in the air\
like grapes overflowing across tables\
People balanced drinks in both hands,\
vendors passed figs and lentils to\
shoppers, others rested in Temple Square\
listening to harps, drums, and rumbling carts\
Children ran ahead of parents, teenagers flirted,\
and something long sleeping in dogs\
awakened in jasmine-chai air

It started to rain, and shrieks of delight\
rose from shoppers as they ran for cover,\
palms to God, laughing and praising His goodness

I dashed under a storefront portico\
and watched passersby clamber\
into carts or throw open tent flaps\
which dropped behind them\
The world was wet like a bathing suit

Some young men crowded\
into the portico beside me, bringing scents of damp linen\
and wine. I could tell they were\
from Sodom by their accents and the ways\
their beards glistened like where the Jordan bends\
and the current changes

One man shouted to another friend\
on the street to bring the cart. The men darted\
out, heads ducked, laughing, spilling\
their mugs of wine\
One man lingered in the portico. He stepped toward me\
and asked *May I kiss you?*

*Yes*

Two rain drops fell onto two rain drops

Then he leapt out of the portico\
and jumped into the cart behind his friends\
It sped into the splashing air. Tables\
overflowed with grapes
