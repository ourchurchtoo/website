**The Easter Lamb**

when I hurt

the helpful people 

have felt hurt 

like it

and really felt it

embodied it

embraced it

and in their fiery hearts

refined it

into pure

empathy



**Jesus of the Scars**

if I have ever sought thee

i seek thee now

your eyes shine

in the dark

the past 

the stars



i need you

your thorned scratched brow

your face

betrayed

paid

your grace

your scars



the other gods were strong

but you were weak

they marched or rode

you stumbled

to a throne



to our pain

only divine pain

can speak

and in my god

my pain is not alone
