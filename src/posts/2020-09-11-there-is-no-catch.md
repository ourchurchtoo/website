The promise of Christ is that all who labour and are heavy laden can receive rest. All who seek and search after God with their hearts will find Him. All who are lost, or downtrodden, or forgotten can be found in Him. Christ made a way for us - sinful, sinful us, to be crowned with glory, and clothed in his righteousness. I don’t know about you, but all this goodness used to make me wonder - “what’s the catch?”

I used to wonder whether when this Jesus feller says “all who labour”, does he also mean me? I’m labouring, sure, I’m heavy laden, but why would he carry me? I’m not part of the ‘in-crowd’; I’m not special. Is it really true that even I, who is so far from ‘looking like Jesus’, who had never really heard of him before I turned 16, can search and find God himself? It seems scary to talk about ‘sin’ and ‘repentance’ and ‘grace’. It seems untrue that the promises of God could be fully and freely available. 

Because the church rejected me. The church hurt me without even knowing it. In several indirect, micro-aggressive ways, and several in-your-face, shameless ways, the church made me feel like I didn’t belong. How can something so broken and imperfect be the plan for the Earth? Isn’t it a bit like using a sieve to catch water from a leaking jug? How then can I still believe the church is God’s plan A, B, and C?

And I do, you know. I do genuinely believe that. I believe that the church is the body, and God is the head. I believe that a community of believers with Jesus at the centre is the best remedy for the pain of the world. I believe that the church is meant to be beautiful, and honouring, and accepting, and loving. I would die for the church, sure, but I live for her as well. 

If I’m honest, I don’t know how these things work together, but they do. Forgiveness, I guess, spirit-led humbling as well. I can think of one hundred times where I’ve said or done something that has made someone else feel rejected that I wish I could take back. I would never excuse those things, or sweep them under the rug. I apologise sincerely, I listen, and I change my behaviour. 

So in case nobody has said this to you, I’m sorry for the church. I’m sorry that we let you down. We are listening, tell us your story, tell us your heart, so that we can change. I love you, we love you, God loves you. Yes, you! The Father of all creation sent his son to die for YOU. And we may not see a perfect church in this life - in fact I’m willing to bet we won’t. But we have seen a perfect Jesus, a perfect sacrifice, and a perfect plan. 

There is no catch.
