Ever since I was young, I've enjoyed the topic of science and the planet. One of my earliest goals in life was to travel into space (still working on this!). My interest in science quickly turned into an excitement for electronics and computing, and it wasn't long until I started working as a developer/ engineer. As a Christian within the tech industry I've had countless peers and colleagues ask me how I can be a smart person who understands and trusts science and also believe in God and Jesus' saving grace.

This question, or misunderstanding, has always had me confused. God's Word has many clear examples of Biblical authors marvelling at His creation before the scientific community had established what we now teach in schools all over the globe. Isaiah 42:20, Job 26:7, and Job 26:10 all talk about the fact our planet is a globe in space. Leviticus 17:11 states that blood gives our flesh life. Psalm 8:8 talks of ocean currents. Further, we have a God that created an earth, a way of life, and a universe that makes sense to the human mind; a God that created an earth that was once a perfect home for mankind.

The climate and environment is a hot talking point politically. In 2020 alone, we’ve had record breaking forest fires, heat waves, storms, and decline of polar sea ice. Most of the damage that scientists claim caused these climate changes has happened in the last few hundred years. We know for a fact that the earth didn’t start out like this: in Genesis God creates earth and says it’s good. He fills it with life and creatures and says it’s good. He then proceeded to tell mankind to take care of the earth, to tend to and keep it, to be good stewards, in Genesis 2:15. This is similar to the command given to Noah after the flood in Genesis 9:1-2. There are even environmental laws: Leviticus 25 points to giving lands rest after harvests and Exodus 22:6 talks about forest fires.

However, in the New Testament we can see a change in tone. Acts 3:19-21 talks about the earth needing repair and how God will be the one that restores it. Revelation 11:17-18 warns about the judgement that will be passed on those that destroy the earth.

I believe it is clear that the earth is God’s creation, that we are called to respect and care for it, as people grateful for the gift that it is, but due to our sinful nature we have failed at this. I'm passionate about the topic of environmental issues and think it's up to us to speak up for our earth. Christians today ought to take care of what we have now, make choices we see as keeping our planet in the best possible shape whilst putting God first.

This means putting climate issues as high value things that we tune our political beliefs to and make personal effort towards. Choosing to be conscious about how we, and our city and country, take care of the surrounding nature and reserves for animals, for example by picking ethically harvested food and resources. In our house we made a choice to cut meat from our diet. There'll be more resources later this week on how to be pro-active.

Ultimately, God’s goal is to restore creation, a renewed heaven and earth where all of God’s people dwell. A perfect earth, where the waters will always run clear and nature will be perfectly in tune to God's will. A sinless earth in harmony.
