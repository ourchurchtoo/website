To be a homosexual is honourable, a gift from God. It is who I am. God makes no mistakes. Knowing the truth as a gay Christian is liberating and gives me the most joy of my freedom.

But I lied, yes you lied...

I have paid the price for lying to be heterosexual. Pretending to be who you are will only harm you. EVERYONE was hurt, my father, mother, wife, son, my siblings, in-laws, friends, and relatives etc.

But I lied, yes you lied.

I was FORCED to lie. I justified these lies with religion, culture, tradition, and law.

But I lied, yes you lied.

To myself for all of my adolescence, I lied (yes you lied) to my family and friends. Because I didn't know any better. \
At the time it didn't seem to matter

To my ex-wife because I was afraid of telling the truth. \
I made those marriage vows in 1991, in the days of my youth.

But I lied, yes you lied.

In my prayers asking God to cure me of homosexuality instead of helping me to come to terms.

My religious belief and dogma nearly killed me. I wrongly married a woman and badly hurt everyone.

But I lied, yes you lied.

In my ministry I lied, (yes you lied) because I was deeply ashamed of who I was, it took my seven years to reconcile and give up the self-stigma, denial, and discrimination.

I suffered emotional and psychological breakdown and through it all I survived.

But I lied, yes you lied.
But I lied, yes you lied.
But I lied, yes you lied.

Through it all the healing begins. I declare that I am a Happy Holy Homosexual. \
My holiness is connected to all things sexual.

I love the Lord God with all of my heart and soul. \
Giving praise from my head to my feet and sole.

I rejoice in knowing who I am and whose I am. \
No more lies, no insults, pain, or harm.

I am an example of God's Pulchritude, \
At best I come with amazing attitude.

Though I lied, (yes you lied) the truth finally sets me free. \
I have become the beacon of hope \
Helping many others to cope \
Thankful to God the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit, the magnificent three.

The Bible tells me, in Romans 9:25-26, those who were not my people I will call my people, \
Those who are not loved shall be called beloved \
In the very place where it is said to them you are not my people there they shall be called children of the living God.

No more lies!
