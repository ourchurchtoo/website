Everybody has those weeks where things just don't go to plan. We love openness and honesty so we feel no shame telling you that this was one of those weeks. 

Here are some suggestions of things to do with the ~3 minutes instead:

* Send someone you love a text saying "just thinking about you."
* Pray for the first person who pops into your head.
* Write a postcard (postcard not provided).
* Drink a cup of tea.
* Read another one of our articles!

 We love you and we will see you on Monday!\
Indy & Erin
