You see, I was stressed\
About life I guess\
Deadlines and \
Fine lines and \
Rewinds. \
And God said \
“I'm going to give you some more time,\
How will you spend it?”\
And I said, \
“There's this game on my iPad\
Like Tetris but with cats”.\
And God said “Okay”,\
And sat with me and watched me play. \
I beat my high score that day\
But I wasn't happy anyway.

So I said, “I'm going to pop to the shop”\
And God said “Sounds great”\
So we went \
And I spent \
And I still felt pressed\
I still felt stressed.

So I said “I'm going to sew”\
And God said “let's go.”\
So I sewed a big blanket- \
Big enough for all my friends.\
And I sat beneath that blanket\
Just me\
Lonely\
Still sad as can be. \
I let it cover me entirely,\
As if it were the sea\
And I was still me\
Deep in the depths\
Running out of breath\
Until. \
What's that I see?\
A light calling for me.\
I swim towards it but I'm cold,\
I know that I can't do it alone. \
And I cry out to God\
“Abba! Father!”\
And a big, warm wave pushes me home.

And I'm safe. \
And I am home. \
And no longer alone. \
And I say \
“I'll use some of this time to pray,\
And some of it will simply slip away,\
And that's okay?”\
I ask\
With a tentative glance. \
And God says “okay,\
I'll love you either way.”
