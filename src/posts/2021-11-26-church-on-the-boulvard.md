  about the church that was formative to his childhood. "

It started with pews 
rows of dust soaked seats stapled to worn wood 
the organ lady, a four-legged octopus behind a half wall. 
Mustachioed men with brown suits, bifocals and stocking feet 
standing on holy ground. 
The world war 2 vet who greeted us, 
crippled in a Japanese POW camp
my father, born to nuclear internment in the Arizona desert 
grasped each other’s hands like sisters. 
A stationary circus of oddities 
complete with a bearded lady, strong men, and dwarves 
awash in a sea of junkyard grace 
adorned with a wooden pulpit, false-wall cross 
and lukewarm baptismal 
occupied by eager 9-year-olds 
and dead daddy long leg floaters. 
Echoes in the gym, skateboards on the curb 
pickup truck jacuzzis and someone finally saying 
that sex was fun. 
Named for the street it sat on 
double doors and single mothers 
hyperactive Christmas goats prancing near cliffsides 
‘Fall off and you’re dead.’ 
A cataclysmic cacophony of monotony 
rhythm backed by an exhibitionist bassist 
and a heretical preacher 
darkened hallways lit only by the green glow 
of an exit sign.
