H: A lot of what Our Church Too does is it’s a conversation point.
Av: Community
El: Listening
Al: Where I’ve been able to learn
Av: Safe
I: Truth spoken against a lie that we are told in society
El: Acceptance
Er: A space where we can learn and listen and grow together
Av: And you can be yourself
Av: Anyone who wants to know the word of God, learn His ways, and talk about it freely without any judgement, this is the best place to be there.
Al: To see how people struggle in different ways than I do.
H: For me, it’s a really crucial way to make sure that I’m not getting comfortable and thinking that my perspective is the only one.
El: So I think ultimately Our Church Too to me is about creating a more loving space in the church, and making it more what God intended and what would make Him happy.
Er: But we still believe that the church is God’s plan.
I: But Our Church Too represents a space where we can both love the church, and we can help her grow in glory and become closer and closer to the vision that Jesus had for her.
As: I find Our Church Too to be a really helpful reminder that even though we all come from different backgrounds, and we have different perspectives on different issues, we all believe in the same God.
