Hadeel: A lot of what Our Church Too does is it’s a conversation point.

Avinash: Community

Elisabeth: Listening

Alida: Where I’ve been able to learn

Avinash: Safe

Indy: Truth spoken against a lie that we are told in society

Elisabeth: Acceptance

Erin: A space where we can learn and listen and grow together

Avinash: And you can be yourself

Avinash: Anyone who wants to know the word of God, learn His ways, and talk about it freely without any judgement, this is the best place to be there.

Alida: To see how people struggle in different ways than I do.

Hadeel: For me, it’s a really crucial way to make sure that I’m not getting comfortable and thinking that my perspective is the only one.

Elisabeth: So I think ultimately Our Church Too to me is about creating a more loving space in the church, and making it more what God intended and what would make Him happy.

Erin: But we still believe that the church is God’s plan.

Indy: But Our Church Too represents a space where we can both love the church, and we can help her grow in glory and become closer and closer to the vision that Jesus had for her.

Asher: I find Our Church Too to be a really helpful reminder that even though we all come from different backgrounds, and we have different perspectives on different issues, we all believe in the same God.
