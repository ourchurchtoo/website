we thrash —\
toddlers spilling\
emotions like warm\
milk flung from sippy cups

\
splashing walls,\
painting the floor\
with slippery ennui.\
outside the steeple stretches,

\
elegant Goddess\
draping our tantrum\
with patience.\
She smiles,

\
door-mouth wide\
swallowing each ultimatum.\
we waltz in, clutching\
precious sorting boxes

\
and label makers.\
so tiny, we are\
kittens lapping confusion\
onto pink tongues. the mingled

\
flavors don’t make sense.\
we want to separate\
sacred contradictions.\
I am one

\
with the three\
year-old crying\
*“I am not a number!”*\
I struggle to fit  

\
my shape wants more space.\
She was a tree\
before we made her church.\
in silence she learned

\
the nature of things. now\
She stands witness\
to our similarities spreading\
thick like constellations

\
spiraling our DNA,\
all of us. Earthlings too focused\
picking out differences\
like bad apples.

\
She cradles us\
Sunday morning\
time-out turns nap\
we all become

> "This poem paints an image of all of our various theological beliefs within the same church building, and how I struggle to feel like I fit in. I can see others feeling the same way. It's about how labels are unhelpful, because we're all the same underneath, all made of the stars." -Joann Renee Boswell
