**I Wish**

I wish\
X. I want Y. Why canâ€™t I

Z. Yet each wish\
has tumbled like stone

down the mountain.\
More and more I 

watch instead of scramble after the stones.\
I do not really want

to search for X.\
Finding Y

no longer interests me.\
I am almost ready

to help other climbers who are still wishing\
find their lost stones

until they, too, come to the pass\
where they would rather

watch than find.

**Almost**

I have one wish\
lodged so deeply in my pocket\
it is unable to spill out\
and tumble like stone\
down the mountain\
and it lies so deeply and tightly inside\
I cannot pull it out\
or ever fully know what it is
