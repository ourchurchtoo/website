*\*Niddah is the Jewish law surrounding female menstruation.*

Strong- assured  
masculine even,  
chiseled rigor of motherhood,  
capable, master expertise  
I march in logical,  
confident,  
until  
bloody Monday  
reminds me;  
creeping like  
a northern leg  
cramp.  
Contractions  
weaker cousin,  
ball bearings  
hanging low  
and heavy  
until the dam breaks,  
kegels grasping  
weakly for cotton  
soaking red  
in her own  
God-damned  
time.  

Bloody Monday  
reminding me  
I am sick  
in some way.  
Giving up  
on my lists,  
productivity  
halted by the welling  
emotions,  
the untenable headache.  
The cracked egg  
opened and slowly  
dribbling yoke  
all over everything.  

I am woman, watch me bleed.

If separate tents granted me spa silence,  
meditative journaling,  
self-reflective  
daily dips in the dead sea  
Sign me up.  
Every month like clockwork.  
This isn’t Godly misogyny;  
this was Divine femininity.  
Built-in reprieve from the need  
to wipe everyone else’s asses;  

to tend to your own bloody hole. 

Reprise the ancient art of menstruation.  
Exalt this Woman’s Club to its proper status.  

Because I know I will miss it  
when it dries up inside of me;  
fertility fleeing like the last  
animals from a forest fire.  

Can I savor the reason  
I ditch my dishes for chocolate  
and oversized sweatpants?  
Can I joyfully blame  
the ridiculous things I say  
in pre-catamenial fever,  
unabashedly brush it off  
“Girls will be girls you know.”  
Everyone cat laughs with pride  
and acceptance. Knowing nods  
relegating the baffled boys  
to their place  
outside the tent.
