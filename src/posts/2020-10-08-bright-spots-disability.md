This week we heard stories and poetry from Deb and Candice. Both are people with disabilities. Candice also identifies as transgender. Each week, we hope these stories leave you with a perspective you might not have had before, deeper empathy, and curiosity that propels you forward to your own growth and curiosity. We recognize that encountering different points of view can be uncomfortable. We want take Fridays to focus on the bright spots: resources and people that are doing something especially well with the topics we have touched on this week. Use this to further your journey into stories that are not often shared in the church:

The New York Institute of Technology Library puts out guides that attempt to provide general information and a starting point to learning about anti-oppression, inclusion, and privilege, as well as provide knowledge and resources to key social justice issues. We especially liked their guide for ableism. Want to hear from more people with disibilities? Check out this Buzz Feed video on what people with disabilities wish able-bodied folks knew:

The Q Center was recommended by our contributor this week, Candice. Q Centers can be found all over the United States. They  provides support groups for people that identify as LGTBQ+ and their families. Candice  found their Queer Bible Study especially enjoyable.
