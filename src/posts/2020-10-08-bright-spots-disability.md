The New York Institute of Technology Library puts out guides that attempt to provide general information and a starting point to learning about anti-oppression, inclusion, and privilege, as well as provide knowledge and resources to key social justice issues. We especially liked their guide for ableism. Want to hear from more people with disibilities? Check out this Buzz Feed video on what people with disabilities wish you knew:

True Colors Unite was co-founded by 80â€™s pop star Cyndi Lauper. They do extensive research and find solutions for homeless youth focused on the LGTBQ+ community. They collaborate in communities and start programs, as well as advocate on the federal, state and local level in the United States. Their site is packed full of information and ideas to combat homelessness among LGTBQ+ youth. Go take a look!

## [The Q Center ](https://www.pdxqcenter.org/?gclid=CjwKCAjwh7H7BRBBEiwAPXjadt8wrYtTxl8VVBIFcLroTZeNgI6mFGRR7XZw_4HWXjXMaK7gAjkyRRoC-_sQAvD_BwE)



The Q Center was recommended by our contributor this week, Candice (link to story?). It provides support groups for people that identify as LGTBQ+ and their families in the greater Portland metro area. Q centers can be found all around the USA. Candice found their Queer Bible Study especially enjoyable.
