This week has been all about feminism. Both Erin and I have posted personal stories about different facets of feminism and christianity, which we hope will lay the groundwork for many more contributions. We believe that feminism is necessarily intersectional because a woman’s experience cannot be reduced to gender alone. If you are keen to learn more about intersectionality, then look up the amazing Kimberlé Crenshaw. 
Below you will find a whole bunch of material to read about Jesus and feminism for your research journey. We hope that these resources enrich and encourage you, and we are excited to hear your feedback!

## On Intersectionality by Kimberlé Crenshaw

This essay collection is essential for any reader who wants to learn more about intersectionality. Black women such as Crenshaw, and notably also bell hooks, paved the way for intersectionality by exposing the underlying racial biases of many classical feminist texts. It is only through this crucial lens that we can really understand the depths of women’s struggles.

## Sarah Bessey “Jesus Feminist”

If you loved Indy’s piece and want to learn more, read Jesus Feminist. Indy became a feminist before she met Jesus, and Bessey became a feminist because she was a Christian. Not ready for a whole book? Listen to this 30 minute sermon by Bessey. She goes into greater detail about intersectionality, allyship and the Church.
