Kissed by him many times, under trees along the brook,\
in the barn loft, in the secluded lane outside the Temple

And then Deuteronomy’s writer—let’s call him, say, Benjamin—\
saw his lover from Sodom\
kiss another man in a portico\
during a sudden rainstorm\
at market

That the lover from Sodom\
shared the grapes on that vine\
so perfectly shaped for Benjamin’s lips,

that all it took was a stranger\
caught in a rainstorm at market\
for the man from Sodom to share a sweetness\
so perfectly lapped by his, Benjamin’s, tongue,

was the bitterness that burned Benjamin’s blood,\
the heat incinerating his veins, the poisonous fumes\
seeped to his mind, 

everyone else scattered and laughing,\
their palms lifted to heaven and praising God’s gifts\
from impromptu shelters, except for Benjamin,

whose lips should be being kissed\
in a portico, but who instead\
stood in the pouring rain
