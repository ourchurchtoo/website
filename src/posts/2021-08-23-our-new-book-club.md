It’s significant that one of the main ways God communicates with us is through written word. Reading about God is very intimate as we all read in our own unique voice, and uncover truths based on our own experiences and understanding. Our relationships with God are unique, a uniqueness that is crafted by God and experienced through our interpretations of the Word. Reading is a gift and a sign of our individuality and ability to learn.

We believe that reading is good for the soul. Reading allows us to take a look at another’s viewpoint and experience. Reading allows us to learn ways of expressing ourselves better. Most of all, reading is fun and transports us to new worlds. We want to encourage you in your reading journey, invite you to critically analyse literature, and get to know you better through our new [Our Church Too Book Club](https://discord.gg/N8wynxDZCt)!

Effectively, [we have set up a discord server](https://discord.gg/N8wynxDZCt) which you can join, with a book club channel. To begin with, this will be a space where we can all share what we are reading, our ideas about certain themes, and our recommendations for other book club members. We are hoping to eventually compile a list, created by you, of books that we can all read together and discuss on the server. This book club is very chill and will follow the same rules as the rest of our content. So please! [Hop on the server and join us](https://discord.gg/N8wynxDZCt)! We would love to see you there.
