Our Church Too has officially launched! Here is a little video which speaks to the mission of the project; we hope it makes you smile! Our vision is simple: you can't love God and not love people. The brightness and happiness in this video expresses the true joy of being loved and seen, but it often comes after a time of hardship and pain. Our Church Too tells those stories of darkness, so that you, and others like you, can live in the light.
