short_description: A little info about the upcoming break.
---
If you've been with us for a while, you know we like to take short breaks every now and then to come up with new ideas and get back on top of admin work. Well, the time has come for another break! But, this time the break is going to look a little different, so we wanted to keep you in the loop. 

**What do you mean by break?**\
We will not be posting new articles to the website for three weeks. We will still be active elsewhere as we will outline below.

**Why break now?**\
This break is a super exciting one for us as it has a special purpose. Indy is moving back to the UK at the end of this month, and we want to give her some space to focus on the move. As well as this, we have a lot of exciting new ventures coming up such as the conference we announced last week, a podcasting series, and a few new contributors. This break gives us time to gear up for the next stage of Our Church Too. 

**What's different?**\
Usually, we go pretty radio silent on our breaks, but this time around we will still be sharing information via our social media and newsletter. For example, we hope to have our conference booking form live this week and will be sharing more information about our merch and what to expect this September. We are also still available for you to get in touch with via our email or socials. 

**What can we do?**\
Whilst we will not be posting new articles for a while, our usual content will still be accessible so please feel free to read anything that you missed out on before and give us your thoughts. If something comes up that you want to write about, please share those with us also! We will be back on track soon and would love to share your articles. Also, don't disappear! We have a lot of exciting announcements coming up and ways for you to get involved.
