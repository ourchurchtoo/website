short_description: Avinash shares his Christmas wish list
---
Dear Lord/Santa\
When I was writing on this topic I realized that, as an adult, having a Christmas Wish is not easy. As kids, we know what toy, or games, or gaming console we want because it was that easy. 

As an adult, it is not easy. We have a lot on our minds and there are too many responsibilities in our lives, and we will make achieving those our Christmas Wish, hoping all of them come true. When writing this wish letter, I wish for only one thing in life: that we make our Lord and saviour as our number one person in life and make sure all things go through Him, and what goes through our life is all God plans, and we be patient and believe in Him.

Regards,\
Avinash
