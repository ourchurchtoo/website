I know a man who used to be a Christian.\
Now he runs the other way and lives in sin.\
He’s ruined his chances with God.

**There is Room at the Table**

But they don’t follow your ways.\
They live as though *they’re* entirely in control.\
They scoff at those who follow the rules.

**There is Room at the Table**

This one is doomed for sure. \
Her life is filled with kind and loving acts.\
But she doesn’t acknowledge God as her source.

**There is Room at the Table**

He never even tried.\
He drinks and shoots up and doesn’t care at all.\
He forgot long ago how to try to be good.

**There is Room at the Table**

Look at the innocence.\
I love babies, they give me hope.\
Yes, but she’s a stubborn one.

**There is Room at the Table**

How disgusting. He lies, cheats, steals.\
He is self-centered in the extreme.\
He causes division and destruction everywhere he sets his foot.

**There is Room at the Table**

Really? \
No one has to obey or even try? \
No one has to follow the rules at all? \
Oh, my child, every one of these is somewhere on the path. \
There is yet time. And,

**There is Still Room at My Table.**
