What would you do if I was you 
And you were me?
What colour would you see?
Mine or yours?
Because right now the darkest one seems to stand out.

Dark times.
Not because of my colour,
But because of your foggy vision,
Skewing your perception.
My heart mourns for my brothers and sisters
Suffering at the hands of an internalised pattern of thinking.

"Racism doesn't exist anymore"
"We abolished that 200 years ago" 
But what if I told you the enslavement is different;
That some are enslaved to being held back -
From reaching their full potential
From living past 18.

"Held black"
Because the extra melanin 
Must mean there's more evil within, 
Maybe less IQ points, 
Somehow less civilised.

But that's not what my God told me.
He said I'm made in His image.
We may all look different, 
But maybe we all proclaim different sides of his goodness.
My skin was never meant to tie me down, 
It was made to raise the Most High high.

We can't change what has been,
But we can write future history;
Truly reconcile it with His story
His heart.
Every tribe and tongue;
I won't stop until I see that kingdom come,
When the bride Christ called is finally made one.

Will you join me?
