AKIYE (Alida) was born in Burundi, grew up in Belgium and now lives in Amsterdam. This cultural dynamic is reflected in her deep curiosity and passion for humans and her musical influences. She spends most of her time studying Sociology and International Development, hanging out with old and new friends, cracking lame jokes and enjoying music. Jesus is her ride or die.
