Andrew Davies was living the dream. A successful dentist, a beautiful wife (inside
and out!), a gorgeous new home - it would have been easy for Andy to be
arrogant, but he truly lived for God. He devoted most of his free time to his church
community.
In 2011 at just 33, Andy had a brainstem stroke that left him completely
paralysed. For a time he and his family went regularly to healing services and
requested prayer. The miracle they were praying for hasn’t happened, but Andy
has learned to speak again, done two degrees, written a couple of books, made
incredible progress with physiotherapy and is a proud father of two boys!

Hurting*’. You can order directly from Andy at dra.davies@virgin.net
