Cheryl Johnson’s background in education and human development is a catalyst for much of her thinking about the value of equipping children for living out their faith in an ever-changing world.  She was the director of a research-based lab school on a major university campus in Vancouver Washington where her research focused on the emotional and social development in children. She also served 30+ years with her husband as a Church planter. She oversaw the Children’s Ministries for most of their ministry.
