Elisabeth is a Sri Lankan Tamil studying economics in Amsterdam. She is a Christian, and her love for God has fuelled her passion for social justice. When she is not studying or engaging with more ‘serious’ things, she loves cuddling with her dog Lady, annoying her cat Scrufferson, cooking for (often at the risk of) her family, and advocating for feminism, vegetarianism, and an introverted lifestyle.
