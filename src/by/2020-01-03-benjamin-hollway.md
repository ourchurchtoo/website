I'm Benjamin, a lead javascript / frontend engineer. Mostly working with React/Vue.js, but also pushing the boundaries with the latest spec of ES and TypeScript, the occasional node module, and a bit of a S/CSS geek. Elsewhere, I love to cook food, cycle, play fetch with Nova, mix live sound, listen to almost any genre of music (and make noise), contribute to open source, hike in the mountains, and spend time with my wife, Indy.
