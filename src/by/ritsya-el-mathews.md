Ritsya-el Mathews is passionate about people, equal opportunities and meaningful connections. Ritsya’s earthly home is constantly moving. In this season, she’s exploring the intersect of her different roles as truth-sayer, wife, mother, coworker, friend and Christianity in a picture-postcard village in the Netherlands. She is always up for a long chat on intersectionality and uncomfortable things.
