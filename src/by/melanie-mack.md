Melanie grew up in various Baptist churches until her mid-twenties. She started her deconstruction after a year-long mission trip to Nigeria in 2012, and it's a journey she's still on! She has always identified as Christian and still does. She is really passionate about openly discussing flaws within the church and working together to make it a safe and inclusive space for allÂ of us.
