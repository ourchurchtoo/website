Esther is a lawyer and activist-in-progress working towards racial and gender equality in Sri Lanka. She's naturally a bit of a hermit, but having been loved so greatly by the Lord Jesus, she is learning to love all, love more, and love openly. She spends the rest of the time doing hermit-y things like cleaning, talking to animals, reading, and making herself laugh. She finds herself hilarious.
