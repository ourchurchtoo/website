A Sydney girl, Ilona is a mama of 3, with a background in Clinical Audiology and Management. Moving to Amsterdam enabled her to change direction and explore her creativity again with a focus on writing and mixed media artwork with a little bit of editing thrown in. She also makes beautiful things and sells them on etsy.
