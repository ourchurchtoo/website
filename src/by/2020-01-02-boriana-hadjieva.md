Boriana is the camerawoman and general hypeman of the Our Church Too team. Her first creative love was writing poetry and doing theatre, and now she is passionate about shooting and editing videos. Having lived in Bulgaria, Northern Ireland and now The Netherlands, she has learnt just how important it is to have a growing faith in Jesus as a stable foundation. Her churches have been by no means perfect, but a crucial part of her faith.
