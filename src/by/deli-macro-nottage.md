Deli is a child and youth worker specialising in trauma, attachment, and gender specific services. She is from East Anglia but now based in Sussex. She has a special interest in Feminist Trauma Theology and is passionate to see a church community that is open, relevant, and shaped to everyone, particularly those who have experienced trauma. She is due to start a master's degree in Childhood and Youth Studies. In her spare time, she can be found rolling around the Sussex hills with toddlers and dogs. She has an undergraduate degree in Art and still loves to create colour wherever she goes.
