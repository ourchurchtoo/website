Kailey Tillman is a passionate 30-year-old, born and raised in Vancouver, WA, USA. She has a soulful longing for travel and experiencing cultures different from her own. She believes that stories are a key factor in breaking down barriers between people. Once you hear someone’s story it’s easy to find connections and see that we have more similarities than we do differences. She and her husband volunteer with International Students Inc where they partner with international students studying at local universities to share cultures, food, friendship and faith. She attends the church she was born and raised in, Grace &amp; Glory Community Church. She has been a worship leader at G&amp;G for over 10 years now. When she’s not at work, you can usually find her running, cooking up scrumptious foods for her family and loving on her two dogs, Vienna and Reykja.
