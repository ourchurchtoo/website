Nat Iwata has worked as an art director, artist, illustrator, professor and animator on everything from video games to children's books. He lives just west of Amsterdam in the beautiful Dutch city of Spaarndam with his wife and 3 boys, all of whom serve as an endless source of encouragement and inspiration. Nat runs on coffee, very little sleep, and an unshakable desire to create something new.
