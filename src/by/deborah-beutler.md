Debs is a Swiss-Canadian, currently living in Lausanne, Switzerland. She has been writing since she was a little girl, and has always had a love of books and stories. She hopes that by sharing her story, and listening as others share theirs, she can grow in seeing people with kind eyes. There is nothing she loves more than a good pun, a deep conversation with close friends, and a very large cup of tea.
