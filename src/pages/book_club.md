header: We want to make connections from one Jesus-lover to another and what
  better way than through our collective love for books? We love the community
  we’re building with you, whether you’re on the other side of the city,
  country, or planet from us! Our book club is going to be fun and light-hearted
  while also leaving space to listen to and discuss another subject of common
  ground with each other (thanks Jesus!). We're looking forward to reading with
  you all!
