## Mission Statement

Our Church Too is a collaborative story sharing platform. The project exists to expand the scope of the church by amplifying the voices of marginalized or excluded people who love Jesus. Our belief is that the church is meant to be the most beautiful, loving, diverse community on earth, where everyone feels safe, beloved, and able to draw closer to Jesus. The church is meant to be a reflection of God’s Kingdom right here and now. Everyone is invited, and everyone belongs.



Our desire to expand the church is two-fold:

1. By changing the perception (attitude, awareness) of people inside of the church.

2. By transforming the perception of the church for people outside the church, for people who do not identify with it. We define “the church” as any group of people following the teachings of Jesus Christ.



We amplify voices through the modality of storytelling, interviews and art. We want to hear the voices of anyone who has felt they do not belong, has been shut down, or struggled to fit into their community of believers. Anyone who has felt they do not belong in their church has been marginalized by humans who are not acting in accordance with the teachings of Jesus. We want to hear about their experiences, and encourage our contributors to express themselves through the medium that they feel most affinity with.



The hope of Our Church Too is to allow the church to go through a metamorphosis and become a more whole reflection of the Kingdom of God. This change should draw the church to be a kinder, more developed, more diverse, expansive, dynamic community of people living like Jesus for the transformation of all the spaces where the church can be found.



The first step is listening and developing empathy. We believe this is best done through storytelling, and our platform will be used to spread the stories of people who are not often heard in the church. We anticipate pain, anguish and disconnect, and aim to meet this with love, compassion and communication.
