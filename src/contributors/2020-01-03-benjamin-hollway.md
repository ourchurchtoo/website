Benjamin is the lead javascript / frontend engineer at Hiber, based in Amsterdam. He mostly works with vue.js, but also pushing the boundaries with the latest spec of ES and TypeScript, and a bit of a S/CSS geek. When heâ€™s not behind a screen, he loves to cook food for others, cycle, mix live & studio sound, listen to almost any genre of music (and make noise), contribute to open source, hike in the mountains, and discover new cafes.
