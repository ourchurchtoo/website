I'm Benjamin, a lead javascript / frontend engineer at Hiber, based in Amsterdam.

Mostly working with vue.js, but also pushing the boundaries with the latest spec of ES and TypeScript, and a bit of a S/CSS geek.

When I'm not behind a screen I love to cook food for others, cycle, mix live & studio sound, listen to almost any genre of music (and make noise), contribute to open source, hike in the mountains, and enjoy discovering new cafes.
